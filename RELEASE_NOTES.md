# Release Notes

## v0.1.0

TS-Reasoner-v0 is the first public proof-of-concept release of the inspectable TS reasoning telemetry pipeline.

This release includes a deterministic standard-library reasoner that maps `question -> candidate chains -> CIG checks -> tension issues -> repair suggestions -> selected low-tension answer -> JSON trace`. It is intentionally not a trained model or benchmark claim; v0 establishes the trace contract and hand-coded tension field that future learned rankers and generators can plug into.

Included:

- Deterministic candidate-chain generation.
- Claim-Interaction Graph extraction with provenance.
- Heuristic local/global tension scoring.
- Traceable repair suggestions.
- CLI, demo script, examples, tests, generated artifacts, model card, and MIT license.
